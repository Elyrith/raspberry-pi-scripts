# Misc Raspberry Pi scripts

## Archival

As of 2025-09-29, I am setting this repository to be an archive. I don't use Raspberry Pis much anymore, and definitely not for my production stuff, so I have no need to continue development.

Still, feel free to use it and/or fork it if you want to use them!

## Description

This is a small collection of scripts to be run on a Raspberry Pi to get a variety of info.

These were written when the latest Raspberry Pi was a 3B+, so may not be as useful anymore.
